# Lollipop-discord-bot

Lollipop is my discord bot, built with discord.js.

## Features

- play music
- delete messages
 
## Usage
 
First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vqlion/Lollipop-discord-bot.git
```

You then need to create a file named ```config.json```. Put your bot's authentification token and application ID in it. 
If you don't know where to find this, or don't know how to create a discord application, check out [this page](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started) for help.

Your ```config.json``` file should look like this:

```json
{
    "token": "<your authentification token>",
    "clientId": "<your application id>"
}
```

Then install the dependencies with npm:
```bash
npm install
```
 
Once you're ready, run the bot:
```bash
node .
```
